## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites:
- A web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.)
- An IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)

### Steps to Setup Locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio-website.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd portfolio-website
   ```

3. **Open the project** in your preferred code editor.

4. **Open `index.html`** in a browser to view the portfolio:

   You can simply double-click the `index.html` file or use an extension like **Live Server** in Visual Studio Code for automatic reloads.

5. **Customization**:
   - To change the images, replace the files in the `img/` folder.
   - You can customize the content of each section directly in `index.html`.
   - Update the social media links and icons in the left sidebar.

## Customization Guide

1. **Changing Profile Image**:
   - Replace the `profile.jpg` in the `img/` folder with your own photo, ensuring the size is similar for consistency.

2. **Adding Services**:
   - In the "My Services" section, you can add or remove service boxes by editing the corresponding HTML structure.
   - Each service block is a Bootstrap card, so you can use the same class structure to add new items.

3. **Editing Animations**:
   - CSS animations are applied to the sidebar and social media icons. You can modify the `@keyframes` in the `style.css` file to change the duration or type of animation.

4. **Adding Blog Posts**:
   - The blog section is static, but you can easily convert it into a dynamic blog if integrated with a backend (like WordPress or a custom CMS).
   
5. **Changing Map Location**:
   - The embedded Google Map in the contact section can be customized by changing the URL in the `iframe` to a new location using the Google Maps platform.

## Animations Used

1. **Fade-in Effect**:
    - Applied to the left sidebar on page load.
    - Can be modified in `style.css` using `@keyframes` and `animation` properties.

2. **Hover Effects**:
    - Social media icons grow slightly when hovered, with a color transition.
    - You can edit the `:hover` properties to change the effect or icon size.

3. **Profile Image Rotation**:
    - The profile picture rotates 360 degrees on hover for a fun, dynamic effect.

## Future Enhancements

- **Add more dynamic content**: The portfolio can be expanded by integrating a backend (e.g., a CMS like WordPress or a headless CMS) for easy updates.
- **Implement Light/Dark Mode**: Create a theme toggle for light and dark mode support.
- **SEO Optimization**: Enhance the website with proper meta tags and open graph tags for better search engine visibility.
